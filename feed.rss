<h4>Why?</h4>
<p>I wanted something I could use in place of socket.io on the <a href="https://github.com/jeremyckahn/pine">Pine</a> project. Because this project will need to be able to send events quickly from browser to node process to node process to browser, I needed something that would not need to parse and rewrite each event. I also wanted to use binary WebSockets because it seemed that they would be faster (and they have proven to be quite fast so far).

I mostly made this blog as a main website to direct people to so they can find me, but I&#39;m also interested in writing about some of my open source exploits. I built the site and blogging engine behind it from scratch, so it will probably have a few problems as I continue to work on it. I like the idea of putting an unfinished site out there, pushing one to work on it; here it is.</p>
