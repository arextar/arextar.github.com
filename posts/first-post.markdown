This is the first post on this blog.<blurb> I mostly made this blog as a main website to direct people to so they can find me, but I'm also interested in writing about some of my open source exploits. I built the site and blogging engine behind it from scratch, so it will probably have a few problems as I continue to work on it. I like the idea of putting an unfinished site out there to push one to work on it. Here it is.
